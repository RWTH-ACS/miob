MIOB, the _Mobile IO Box_ is a flexible unit for interconnecting laboratory equipment and measurements.

Built around a Xilinx Ultrascale+ VC106 FPGA evaluation board, it provides both computation power and IO flexibility for various interfacing tasks in a laboratory.

This repository contains the construction drawings, bill of materials, software and general documentation for building your own MIOB.
